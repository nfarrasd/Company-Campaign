with modifications in the syntaxes (analyses methods and approaches) as well as the final report.

# Business Understanding
## Background
After successful campaigns in three cities: 01CT, 02CT, and 03CT during 2019. The company uses the same 
strategy but with a new objective as follows:
1. Acquire a minimum of 150 new live merchants every month
2. Keep the retention rate a minimum of 85% of last year's existing merchants
3. Increase promo discount participation rate to a minimum of 30% of all merchants

## Problems
The company needs us to assess the two month (January-February 2020) campaign performance to 
determine whether to continue the campaign or not.

## Analytical Approaches

2. To find the percentage of last yearâ€™ who stayed merchants in these two months (overall and in each city).
3. To find the merchant promo participation rate in these two months (overall and in each city).
