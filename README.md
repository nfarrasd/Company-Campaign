# Company Campaign Strategy
This project was a mandatory task for DataPath 1-month Bootcamp in August-September 2021, 
with modifications in the syntaxes (analyses methods and approaches) as well as the final report.

# Business Understanding
## Background
After successful campaigns in three cities: 01CT, 02CT, and 03CT during 2019. The company uses the same 
strategy but with a new objective as follows:
1. Acquire a minimum of 150 new live merchants every month
2. Keep the retention rate a minimum of 85% of last year's existing merchants
3. Increase promo discount participation rate to a minimum of 30% of all merchants

## Problems
The company needs us to assess the two month (January-February 2020) campaign performance to 
determine whether to continue the campaign or not.

## Analytical Approaches
1. To find the acquisition performance of new live merchants in these two months (overall and in each city).
2. To find the percentage of last year’ who stayed merchants in these two months (overall and in each city).
3. To find the merchant promo participation rate in these two months (overall and in each city).

# Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is credential.

# Result
## Summary
1. New Live Merchants: In Jan 2020, the objective was exceeded by 27% (city 03C 
as the main ‘contributor’), but it dropped heavily in the following month.
2. Retention Rate: Though it was below the target, there is a huge increment of the 
retention rate in Feb 2020, from the average of 33.06% to 80.05% in all cities (city 
03C has the best retention rate (87.16% in Feb 2020)
3. Promo Participation Rate: Though city 03C is the only city which exceeded the 
target, there is a good increment trend on promo participation rate in city 01C.

## Recommendation
1. A discussion involving various teams in the campaign are needed (e.g. Marketing, RnD) to fully 
understand the situation in the past 2 months, i.e. competitors existence, poor quality products, etc.
2. City 03C is the most promising city based on these two months performance, though several actions 
are recommended, such as:
    * Run a campaign with the focus on acquiring new merchants with good quality.
    * Build and maintain good relations with merchants in 03C to cooperate for a long-term period.
3. Provide incentives to the merchants as a means to increase the merchant’ promo participation rate.
4. Run the campaign in 01C and 02C to see if there is a continuous positive trend in March (if possible)
